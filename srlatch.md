# SR Latch 
A latch is a type of memory device that remembers one bit. SR latch has 2 inputs, S and RT. S for set and R for reset. There is also an output called Q.

As you can see, this is how the table works for the operation of an SR latch. 

However, by design, when you press S and R at the same time, it is an invalid input and the value of Q is undefined.
